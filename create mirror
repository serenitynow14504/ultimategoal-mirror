In order to create a mirror:

1. First go to https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge

2. Be logged in as serenitynow14504@gmail.com

3. Navigate to the correct repo in place in 1 above

4. Fork the repo by pressing the fork button.  Choose serenitynow14504 as the place to create the fork

5. The fork is public and cannot be made private.  To have it private, we need to mirror it. So create a new repo in serenitynow14504.
if the forked repo was foo, call this foo-mirror for example. Make the mirror private.

6. Add pie474 as a collaborator.  Chinmay may need to sign out of github and sign in as himself, then go to his email, and click on the
accept button that will take him to github to accept.

7. In a terminal window, clone the fork (in an appropriate directory by first cd'ing there):

git clone --bare https://github.com/serenitynow14504/UltimateGoal.git

(for example, using UltimateGoal.git above)

8. This will create a directory UltimateGoal.git in whatever directory we are in the terminal. Do cd UltimateGoal.git

9. Now push the fork into the mirror repository we created above:

git push --mirror https://github.com/serenitynow14504/ultimategoal-mirror/

10. After this, we can remove the clone of the fork:
cd ..
$ rm -rf UltimateGoal.git


This is for rebasing from FTC Skystone (or the new one, replace with the correct directory names) repo (not our forked one)

git checkout develop
git fetch https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/SkyStone.git
git rebase master

the first command may not be needed again since the upstream should be set to our own fork
do the same thing for the fork first: ie, serenitynow14504/Skystone.git
for that the upstream is set to the FTC site's master, and the remote add upstream command may not be needed
can do any just for completeness:

git remote add upstream https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/SkyStone.git
do the same as below to rebase it first.  then do the below to our mirror of the fork.  the mirror is there
so that we can be private.
it's possible to make the upstream of the mirror the FTC one directly and not bother with our fork,
but haven't tried that.

git remote add upstream https://github.com/serenitynow14504/SkyStone.git
git fetch upstream
git checkout master
git rebase upstream/master
git push
